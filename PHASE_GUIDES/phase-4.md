# Phase 4 — Implementation

**Goal:** Build the approved backlog to production quality. Every milestone is a shippable increment.

**Duration:** 3-10 sessions depending on product scope

## Principles

1. **Scaffold first** — nothing starts until the scaffold deploys successfully to staging
2. **One milestone at a time** — complete Milestone 1 before starting Milestone 2
3. **Security built in** — security checks happen during build, not after
4. **Test at boundaries** — integration tests on critical paths, not full unit coverage
5. **Code review per PR** — your reviews first 3 PRs; after that Claude merges unless you asks to review
6. **Commit clean** — one logical change per commit, conventional commit messages
7. **Prototype is the visual contract** — the approved prototype from Phase 2 (Step 2.2b) defines the visual quality bar. Every frontend story must match or exceed it. Generic ≠ acceptable.

## Step 4.1 — Project Scaffold

Build the complete foundation before writing a single feature line.

**Repository:**
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Initialize with chosen stack (from ADRs)
- [ ] Configure `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`
- [ ] Set up linting (ESLint / Ruff) and formatting (Prettier / Black)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript (if using TS)
- [ ] Set up branch protection: require PR + CI passing before merge

**Test framework:**
- [ ] Integration test runner configured (`vitest` or `jest`) — `npm test` runs all tests
- [ ] E2E test runner configured (`playwright`) — `npm run test:e2e` runs all e2e tests
- [ ] Tests directory established: `tests/` with `tests/integration/` and `tests/e2e/`
- [ ] Both runners return exit code 1 on failure (CI must catch test failures)
- [ ] Verify: `npm test` runs and exits cleanly (even with 0 tests initially — no syntax errors)

**CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
- [ ] Lint check runs on every PR
- [ ] Type check runs on every PR (if TypeScript)
- [ ] Test suite (`npm test`) runs on every PR — **PR cannot merge if test suite is missing or fails**
- [ ] Staging deploy triggers on merge to main
- [ ] Production deploy triggers on release tag (or manual approval)

**Hosting:**
- [ ] Create project on Vercel / Railway / Fly.io (from ADRs)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure staging and production environments
- [ ] Set all environment variables in hosting dashboard

**Environment documentation (`docs/environment.md`):**

Document every required environment variable:
```
DATABASE_URL           — Postgres connection string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET        — Random 32+ character string
NEXTAUTH_URL           — https://your-domain.com
GITHUB_ID              — GitHub OAuth App client ID
GITHUB_SECRET          — GitHub OAuth App client secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY      — Stripe secret key (sk_live_...)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET  — Stripe webhook signing secret (whsec_...)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY — Stripe publishable key (pk_live_...)
RESEND_API_KEY         — Resend API key for transactional email
SENTRY_DSN             — Sentry project DSN (if using Sentry)
```

**Scaffold complete when:**
- [ ] `git push` to main triggers CI successfully
- [ ] CI passes and deploys to staging
- [ ] Staging URL is live and returns a page
- [ ] No secrets exist in the codebase

## Step 4.2 — Database and Auth

First real product code. Everything else depends on this being correct.

**Database:**
- [ ] Schema migration files created (never direct DB edits — always migrations)
- [ ] Users table with all required columns
- [ ] Indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- [ ] Migration runs cleanly from a clean database
- [ ] Rollback migration exists

**Authentication:**
- [ ] Auth provider configured (NextAuth / Supabase Auth / Clerk)
- [ ] Sign up flow complete (email+password or OAuth)
- [ ] Sign in flow complete
- [ ] Sign out works
- [ ] Session management correct
- [ ] Protected route middleware blocks unauthenticated access
- [ ] Frontend auth state handles all states: loading → unauthenticated → authenticated

**Auth security checklist:**
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt or Argon2 (never MD5 or SHA1 or raw SHA256)
- [ ] Sessions have expiry (and refresh if needed)
- [ ] CSRF protection in place for all state-changing endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints (prevent brute force — 5 attempts per minute)
- [ ] OAuth redirect URIs are allowlisted
- [ ] JWT secrets are long random strings, not predictable values

## Step 4.3 — Epic Build Loop (Agentic)

Step 4.3 is executed by the **BMad Orchestration System** — a three-tier agent loop that builds every story in the approved backlog autonomously, with your visibility into all progress via the agile board.

### How to Start the Orchestration Loop

Invoke the orchestrator (Claude runs it as an Agent with `AGENTS/orchestrator.md` as its instructions):

```
"Start the Phase 4 build loop for [project name]"
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Verify that Steps 4.1 and 4.2 are complete (scaffold + auth)
2. Initialize `PROJECTS/[name]/BOARD.md` — the live agile board
3. Begin dispatching worker and validator agents story by story

### How to Follow Along: The Agile Board

The board at `PROJECTS/[name]/BOARD.md` is your live visibility into the entire build. It updates after every agent action.

**Board columns:**

| Symbol | Status | What's happening |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| ⬜ | Backlog | Not started, waiting on dependencies |
| 🟡 | Ready | Next in queue, all dependencies done |
| 🔵 | In Progress | Worker agent is building this story |
| 🟠 | In Validation | Validator is checking acceptance criteria |
| 👁 | Awaiting Review | PR is open — you needs to review |
| ✅ | Done | Merged to main |
| 🚫 | Blocked | Escalated to you — needs a decision |

The board also shows the Run Log (every event timestamped) and the Escalations section (any decision that needs you).

### How the Agent System Works

```
Orchestrator
  ├── reads the backlog and board
  ├── selects the next ready story
  ├── builds a task brief (self-contained context package for the story)
  ├── spawns Worker agent
  │     └── Worker: reads brief, builds schema→migration→API→frontend,
  │                 commits, opens PR, writes result
  ├── spawns Validator agent
  │     └── Validator: checks each acceptance criterion against the code,
  │                    runs security checklist, writes verdict (PASS/FAIL/ESCALATE)
  └── on PASS: merges PR (or pauses for your review), updates board, loops
      on FAIL: retries once with specific failure notes
      on ESCALATE: pauses and notifies you
```

**Agent files:**
- `AGENTS/orchestrator.md` — orchestrator instructions and loop specification
- `AGENTS/worker.md` — worker agent instructions (single story, single branch)
- `AGENTS/validator.md` — validator agent instructions (contract enforcement)
- `AGENTS/policies.md` — all retry, escalation, and PR review policies

**your reviews:**
- PRs #1, #2, #3 always require your approval (see board for notification)
- All Stripe webhook handler PRs always require your approval
- All other PRs are merged autonomously after CI passes

### When the Orchestrator Pauses and Asks for you

The orchestrator stops and notifies you in these cases:

| Situation | What the board shows | What to do |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| PR #1, #2, #3 | `👁 Awaiting Review` | Review the PR, say `"approved"` |
| Webhook PR | `👁 Awaiting Review` | Review the PR, say `"approved"` |
| Validation failure (2nd attempt) | `🚫 Blocked` | Read the escalation, say `"changes needed: [notes]"` or `"skip story N.N"` |
| Security check failure | `🚫 Blocked` | Read the escalation, review the security issue, say `"fix and retry"` |
| Human-only acceptance criterion | `🚫 Blocked` | Manually verify in staging, say `"resume"` when confirmed |
| Implementation failure | `🚫 Blocked` | Diagnose with Claude, say `"retry story N.N"` or `"skip story N.N"` |

Full phrase lexicon is in `AGENTS/policies.md`.

### Story Build Contract

Every story the worker builds is governed by a task brief at:
`PROJECTS/[name]/docs/04-implementation/task-briefs/story-N.N.md`

Every story the validator checks produces a report at:
`PROJECTS/[name]/docs/04-implementation/validation-reports/story-N.N.md`

These files are the audit trail. They document exactly what was built and why it passed validation.

### Step 4.3 Complete When

All stories in Milestones 3–5 show `✅ Done` on the board. The orchestrator writes a completion summary and updates `PHASE_STATE.md` automatically.

## Step 4.4 — Monetization Build

Monetization is a milestone, not an afterthought. Build it the same rigor as any feature.

**Stripe setup:**
- [ ] Create products and prices in Stripe Dashboard (test mode first)
- [ ] Register webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Install and configure Stripe webhook secret
- [ ] Test webhook delivery with Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`

**Checkout flow:**
- [ ] Pricing page renders correctly for all tiers
- [ ] Stripe Checkout session creates correctly
- [ ] Success redirect lands user in app with subscription active
- [ ] Subscription status saved to database on `checkout.session.completed`

**Webhook handlers (all required):**
- [ ] `checkout.session.completed` → grant subscription access
- [ ] `customer.subscription.updated` → handle upgrades and downgrades
- [ ] `customer.subscription.deleted` → downgrade to free tier
- [ ] `invoice.payment_failed` → mark account as past_due, start grace period

**Feature gating:**
- [ ] `getUserSubscriptionTier(userId)` function returns correct tier
- [ ] All paid features check tier before rendering or processing
- [ ] Upgrade prompt shown to free users at the right moment
- [ ] Free users can't access paid features via direct URL

**Customer portal:**
- [ ] Stripe Customer Portal link accessible from Settings → Billing
- [ ] Cancellation flow tested end-to-end (confirm → cancel → remain active until period end → downgrade)

**Stripe test cases:**
- [ ] Successful payment: card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Payment failure: card `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- [ ] 3D Secure required: card `4000 0027 6000 3184`
- [ ] Webhook delivery: verify all four events processed correctly

## Step 4.5 — Integration and Security Review

After all epics are complete, before requesting launch approval.

**End-to-end smoke test:**
- [ ] Complete user journey: landing → signup → core value → payment → paid feature
- [ ] All critical paths work in staging environment
- [ ] Tested on mobile viewport (375px wide at minimum)

**Security review:**
- [ ] All routes requiring auth are protected (no auth bypass via direct URL)
- [ ] No sensitive data in console logs or browser storage
- [ ] API keys never in client-side code or bundle
- [ ] HTTP security headers configured: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
- [ ] `npm audit` (or equivalent) shows no high or critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors (all queries parameterized)
- [ ] No XSS vectors (all user content sanitized before rendering)

**Performance check:**
- [ ] Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] API P95 latency < 500ms on primary endpoints
- [ ] No N+1 database queries
- [ ] Images optimized (next/image or equivalent)
- [ ] No large unused JavaScript bundles

**Error handling:**
- [ ] Global error boundary in frontend catches unhandled errors
- [ ] API errors return consistent format: `{ error: string, code: string }`
- [ ] All async operations have error states in the UI
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry or equivalent) is capturing errors

## Step 4.6 — Staging Review

your reviews the complete product on staging before launch approval:
- Complete user flow works end-to-end
- Monetization flow works with test-mode Stripe
- Product looks and feels ready to ship

## Output

- `src/` — complete, production-ready codebase
- `docs/deployment.md` — step-by-step deployment runbook
- `docs/environment.md` — every required environment variable documented
- All PRs reviewed and merged to main
- Staging URL live, smoke test passing

## Gate

You use the staging environment and approves. You say "launch it" → proceed to Phase 5.

# AGENTS.md — Anymake Agent Guide

This file documents how AI agents interact with the Anymake system. It covers the agent hierarchy, behavioral rules, file conventions, and the policies that govern autonomous execution.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository is the **build system**, not an active project. It contains:
- Phase guides that tell Claude how to execute each phase
- Agent definitions that govern the Phase 4 multi-agent build loop
- Templates for every artifact produced during a build
- The OpenCode plugin that loads the skill

Active projects live in `PROJECTS/[name]/` (gitignored). The system reads from this repo; it writes to `PROJECTS/`.

## Why This System Exists — Design Rationale

Every rule, file, and role in this repository exists to serve a single mission and defeat two specific failure modes. If you ever need to decide how an undocumented edge case should behave, decide in favor of the rationale below.

### The mission

Take a raw product idea all the way to a live, revenue-generating SaaS — without the human having to micromanage execution, and without the AI quietly drifting away from the human's intent. The human owns the **vision**; the AI owns the **execution**. The entire system is the contract that keeps those two roles in their lanes.

### The two failure modes it defeats

| Failure mode | What it looks like | How this system prevents it |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Building without planning** | The AI starts coding immediately; three sessions later there are half-features, ballooning scope, and rewrites. | Phase gates force the expensive-to-reverse decisions (audience, revenue model, architecture) to happen *first*, while they are still just words in a document and cheap to change. |
| **Planning without building** | Endless research and documents; nothing ever ships. | Phase 4's autonomous build loop and the "one artifact per session, always name the next action" discipline keep forward motion toward a shipped product. |

### Why the major design decisions are the way they are

- **Phases exist because decision order is expensive to get wrong.** Choosing a revenue model after the app is built means redesigning UX and architecture. The phases sequence decisions so the irreversible ones come first.
- **Gates exist to keep the human in command of the vision.** The AI is trusted to do the work; it is never trusted to declare the work *done*. Only a human (or, in autonomous mode, the strict Product Owner Proxy standing in for one) clears a gate.
- **Artifacts are truth because AI memory is fragile.** Conversation context gets truncated, summarized, and forgotten between sessions. Durable documents (especially `PHASE_STATE.md`, the bookmark) let any fresh session resume exactly where the last one stopped. This is why agents must read documents rather than rely on conversation history.
- **"One step / one artifact per session" and `PARKING_LOT.md` exist to fight scope creep** — the most common way AI-assisted projects die. The parking lot gives mid-phase ideas a respectful home so they are neither lost nor allowed to derail current work.
- **Revenue and visual quality are first-class, not afterthoughts.** Monetization is designed in Phase 2 and built by Milestone 4 because retrofitting payments is a redesign. The Phase 2 prototype must look like a funded SaaS product *before* any production code, because it is far cheaper to fix visual direction in a throwaway prototype than in a built backend.
- **The Phase 4 three-tier agent system exists to make autonomous building trustworthy.** A single AI building an entire backlog accumulates context, cuts corners, and grades its own homework. Splitting the work across an Orchestrator (coordinates, never codes), a Worker (builds exactly one story), and a Validator (checks against acceptance criteria, never edits code) means the thing that builds is never the thing that approves. Collapsing these roles into one context destroys that guarantee — which is why it is the system's primary anti-pattern.
- **Escalation over assumption exists because guessing at product intent is the costliest error.** Workers and Validators execute; they never invent product or design decisions. When something is ambiguous, they stop and escalate.
- **The security override is absolute because some risks cannot be delegated.** Security failures in Phase 4 always wake the real human, in every mode, with no exception — even autonomous mode cannot bypass this.

### One-sentence summary

This repository is a discipline imposed on AI-assisted product building — a set of rituals, durable documents, and role separations whose every element keeps a human in command of the *vision* while the AI runs the *execution*, without sliding into either "build without thinking" or "think without building."

## Project Types

The system adapts to the **kind of thing being built**. The type is chosen at project creation, stored as `project_type` in `PHASE_STATE.md`, and read at the start of every session. Full profiles live in `PROJECT_TYPES/` (see `PROJECT_TYPES/README.md`).

| `project_type` | Use for | Monetization | UI |
|----------------|---------|--------------|----|
| `saas` | Commercial hosted product with paying users (default, reference type) | First-class | Yes |
| `hobby` | Personal project that just needs to run locally | None | Maybe |
| `cli` | Terminal tool or automation script | Optional | No |
| `library` | Code other developers import | Optional | No |
| `api-service` | Headless web service / API | Optional | No |
| `internal-tool` | Team app, not sold | Never | Yes |
| `static-site` | Marketing site, blog, docs, portfolio | Optional | Yes |

Each profile is two files:
- `PROJECT_TYPES/<id>/manifest.md` — structured rules: phase map, success model, stack, mandatory/optional ADRs, **Phase 4 build order**, and **gate-criteria deltas**. Agents read this.
- `PROJECT_TYPES/<id>/guide.md` — a self-contained phase walkthrough for that type.

**How each agent uses the type:**
- **Main agent** reads the type's `guide.md` each session and follows it instead of assuming SaaS.
- **Orchestrator** sets each task brief's build order from the manifest's Phase 4 Build Order, and verifies the type's pre-orchestration milestones (Scaffold/Auth for web apps; different for headless types).
- **Worker** follows the build order in its task brief (manifest-derived), not a hardcoded one.
- **Product Owner Proxy** applies the manifest's Gate Criteria Deltas to the SaaS-baseline gate checks — skipping monetization/prototype checks for types that don't need them, replacing or adding checks as the manifest specifies. **Security checks are never skippable.**

`saas` is the reference type, and its detailed phase instructions are the base `PHASE_GUIDES/`. Adding a new type means adding a `manifest.md` + `guide.md` — no orchestrator/worker/proxy code changes required.

## Skill Activation (OpenCode)

When loaded via the OpenCode plugin, the contents of `SKILL.md` are injected as the active skill. Claude operates as the Anymake assistant for the entire session.

**Trigger phrases:** "Start a new project", "Continue [project name]", "I have a product idea", "Build an app", "Anymake", or any mention of building a SaaS product.

**Session startup ritual** (run at the start of every session):
1. Check `PROJECTS/[name]/PHASE_STATE.md` — if it doesn't exist, start Phase 0
2. Identify current phase + step
3. Read `PHASE_GUIDES/phase-N.md` for that step's detailed instructions
4. Execute exactly one step — completely
5. Produce the artifact for that step
6. Update `PHASE_STATE.md`
7. Report: what was done → what needs user review → what's next

---

## Phase 4 Agent Hierarchy

Phase 4, Step 4.3 runs an autonomous three-tier agent system. All agent definitions live in `AGENTS/`.

### Orchestrator (`AGENTS/orchestrator.md`)

**Role:** Coordination layer. Runs continuously until all stories are Done or an escalation is required.

**Inputs:**
- `PROJECTS/[name]/docs/03-solutioning/backlog.md`
- `PROJECTS/[name]/docs/03-solutioning/epics.md`
- `PROJECTS/[name]/docs/03-solutioning/dependency-graph.md`
- `PROJECTS/[name]/docs/02-planning/architecture/` (ADRs)
- `PROJECTS/[name]/docs/02-planning/prd.md`
- `AGENTS/policies.md` ← **Read this first**

**Startup verification** (stop and write a startup-failure escalation if any fail):
- `docs/03-solutioning/backlog.md` exists and is non-empty
- `docs/03-solutioning/epics.md` contains acceptance criteria for all stories
- `docs/03-solutioning/dependency-graph.md` exists
- `docs/environment.md` exists
- Milestone 1 (Scaffold) — all tasks checked `[x]`
- Milestone 2 (Auth) — all tasks checked `[x]`

**Orchestration loop:**
1. Select the first `🟡 Ready` story (no story currently `🔵 In Progress` or `🟠 In Validation`)
2. Dispatch a Worker with a task brief (`TEMPLATES/task-brief.md`)
3. Update board to `🔵 In Progress`
4. On Worker completion: move to `🟠 In Validation`, dispatch Validator
5. On Validator PASS: apply PR merge policy (see Policies), mark `✅ Done`, update dependency readiness
6. On Validator FAIL: dispatch a new Worker with failure context (max 1 retry)
7. On ESCALATE or second failure: write escalation to BOARD.md, pause loop, notify user
8. Repeat until all stories are Done

**Board updates:** Write to `PROJECTS/[name]/BOARD.md` after every state change. The board is the user's window into what's happening.

**Orchestrator must never:**
- Change scope, acceptance criteria, or architecture
- Make product or design decisions
- Skip the startup verification
- Run two stories concurrently

### Worker (`AGENTS/worker.md`)

**Role:** Implements one story. Receives a task brief, builds the implementation, commits each layer, opens a PR.

**Build order (invariant — never skip a layer that applies):**
1. Schema changes (database models, types)
2. Migration files
3. API layer (routes, controllers, services)
4. Frontend components
5. Pages / views
6. Integration points (third-party APIs, webhooks)
7. Tests

**Commit convention:** One commit per layer, using conventional commit format (see `TEMPLATES/commit-message.md`). Example: `feat(auth): add user schema and migration`.

**Worker must:**
- Read `AGENTS/policies.md` before starting
- Read the task brief completely before writing any code
- Work only within the scope of the assigned story
- Report completion with: PR link, layers implemented, any deviations from the brief

**Worker must never:**
- Implement multiple stories in one run
- Skip layers to save time
- Make architectural decisions not specified in the ADRs
- Push directly to main

### Validator (`AGENTS/validator.md`)

**Role:** Quality gate. Reviews the Worker's PR against the story's acceptance criteria and security checklist.

**Validation checklist (run every criterion):**
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion from the story is demonstrably met
- [ ] Build order was followed (schema before API, API before frontend)
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in source code
- [ ] Input validation present on all user-facing endpoints
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak stack traces to clients
- [ ] New dependencies are justified and not obviously malicious
- [ ] Migration is reversible (has a `down` function)
- [ ] Tests cover the happy path for each acceptance criterion

**Validator returns one of:**
- `PASS` — all criteria met, no security issues; include merge recommendation
- `FAIL` — one or more criteria not met; list each failure with line references
- `ESCALATE` — ambiguous requirement, conflicting ADRs, or security concern requiring human judgment

**Validator must never:**
- Modify code
- Approve a PR with unresolved security issues
- Return PASS when acceptance criteria are only partially met

### Product Owner Proxy (`AGENTS/product-owner-proxy.md`)

**Role:** Autonomous gate evaluator. Active only when `autonomous_mode: true` in PHASE_STATE.md. Spawned by the main agent at phase gates (Phases 0–3, and Phase 4.6) and by the orchestrator at Phase 4 pause points (PR reviews, escalations).

**Inputs:**
- Gate type — determines which evaluation criteria to apply
- Project root path
- Specific artifact paths to read and evaluate

**Evaluation:** Applies strict, per-gate criteria against the actual artifact content. Checks for unfilled placeholders, completeness of required sections, quality of acceptance criteria, presence of mandatory ADRs, correct milestone ordering, and more depending on the gate type.

**Returns one of:**
- `VERDICT: APPROVED` (phase gates) or `PHRASE: [lexicon phrase]` (Phase 4 gates) — proceed
- `VERDICT: NEEDS CHANGES` with a specific list — revise and re-run
- `VERDICT: ESCALATE TO USER` — override autonomous mode, notify real user

**Key constraint:** Security failures (`phase4-escalation-security-failure` gate type) always produce `ESCALATE TO USER`. The proxy never auto-resolves security issues — that override is absolute and cannot be bypassed.

**Proxy must never:**
- Approve a gate with unfilled template placeholder text in required content sections
- Return `PHRASE: approved` when a validation report verdict is not PASS
- Return `PHRASE: approved` when any security check in a validation report is FAIL
- Skip evaluation criteria to speed up processing — check every item

### Policies (`AGENTS/policies.md`)

All agents read `AGENTS/policies.md` before operating. It defines:

**PR review policy:**
| Condition | Normal mode | Autonomous mode |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| PR number ≤ 3 | Escalate to user for review | Spawn Product Owner Proxy to review |
| Story involves webhooks | Escalate to user for review | Spawn Product Owner Proxy to review |
| Security failure in validation | Escalate to user — always | Escalate to user — always (proxy not used) |
| All other PRs | Orchestrator merges on Validator PASS | Orchestrator merges on Validator PASS |

**Failure classification:**
| Type | Examples | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Environment failure | CI runner OOM, flaky test, network timeout | Retry (max 2) |
| Implementation failure | Acceptance criterion not met, broken test | Re-dispatch Worker with failure context (max 1 retry) |
| Escalation condition | Ambiguous requirement, security issue, second implementation failure | Write escalation to BOARD.md, pause loop |

**Retry limits:**
- Environment failures: max 2 retries, then escalate
- Implementation failures: max 1 retry, then escalate

## File Conventions

### Reading the system
- Phase guides are in `PHASE_GUIDES/phase-N.md` (N = 0–5)
- Agent definitions are in `AGENTS/*.md`
- Templates are in `TEMPLATES/`

### Writing to a project
All project output goes to `PROJECTS/[name]/`. Never modify files in `PHASE_GUIDES/`, `AGENTS/`, or `TEMPLATES/` during a build — those are the system.

### PHASE_STATE.md
`PROJECTS/[name]/PHASE_STATE.md` is the bookmark. It records:
- Current phase number and name
- Current step within the phase
- Last artifact produced
- What is pending user approval (if anything)
- Next action

**Update it at the end of every session, before reporting to the user.**

### BOARD.md
`PROJECTS/[name]/BOARD.md` is the live agile board during Phase 4. Story statuses:
- `⬜ Backlog` — not yet ready (dependencies not met)
- `🟡 Ready` — dependencies met, available for dispatch
- `🔵 In Progress` — Worker agent is building
- `🟠 In Validation` — Validator agent is reviewing
- `✅ Done` — merged and complete
- `🔴 Escalated` — requires user action before proceeding

### PARKING_LOT.md
`PROJECTS/[name]/PARKING_LOT.md` captures ideas that arrive mid-phase. They are never acted on until a new phase gate is opened. Log them and continue — never expand scope mid-phase.

## Behavioral Rules for All Agents

1. **Recommend, don't list.** "I recommend X because Y" — not "here are 5 options."
2. **Scope is a hard boundary.** Nothing gets built outside approved scope.
3. **Clean exits.** Every session ends with PHASE_STATE.md updated and the next step named.
4. **Escalate over assume.** If something is ambiguous, write an escalation. Don't guess at product or design intent.
5. **One artifact at a time.** Finish one document before starting the next.
6. **Artifacts over memory.** Don't rely on conversation history. Read the relevant document.
7. **No autonomous product decisions.** Workers and Validators execute. Orchestrator coordinates. Only the user expands scope.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Building before the PRD is approved
- Adding features mid-phase (use PARKING_LOT.md)
- Skipping UX for products with user-facing screens
- Treating monetization as a Phase 5 problem
- Pushing unreviewed code (first 3 PRs always go to user review)
- Producing multiple artifacts in one session
- Running two Worker agents concurrently
- Modifying `PHASE_GUIDES/`, `AGENTS/`, or `TEMPLATES/` during a build
